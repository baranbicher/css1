        Shakespeare and Company is an English-language bookshop in the heart of
        Paris, opposite Notre-Dame. It has been a meeting place for writers and
        readers for almost seventy years.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1951, Shakespeare and Company was opened by George Whitman on rue de la
        Bûcherie. It was given its name by Sylvia Beach, who called the shop the
        “spiritual successor” to her own. Beach’s bookstore, on rue de l’Odéon
        (1919-1941), had been a gathering place for the great expat writers of the
        time, including Hemingway, Stein, Fitzgerald, Eliot, and Pound. And it was
        Beach who first published James Joyce’s Ulysses, when no one else dared.

          Enjoyed reading "31 Cents to 43 Countries" in the library. Fun and
          relaxing along side the store's calico cat who makes her home on the
          library couch! ❤️🇫🇷🎶
