<p>
    Shakespeare and Company was the name of the iconic English language
    bookstore founded by Sylvia Beach in 1919 on Paris' Left Bank, and where
    Beach went on to publish James Joyce's "Ulysses." A later independent
    English-language bookstore was opened in 1951 by George Whitman, also
    located on Paris' Left Bank, but under a different name. Whitman adopted
    the "Shakespeare & Co." name for his store in 1965, and it continues to
    operate under that name to this day. <a
